// 1. Solve the same problem above but in much less code. Hint: Look at how the solution
// treats the variable called row. It keeps setting it to an empty string and then adding all
// the stars for the row. An alternative might be to initialise it to the empty string and add
// one star to it before we log the value of the row. Starting again with this idea might give
// us the following Step 1. Can you take the necessary steps to turn this into a different
// solution to the same problem?

let row = "";
let numberOfRows = 5;
let count = 0;
// print one row

while (count < numberOfRows) {
  row = row + "*";
  count++;
  console.log(row);
}

// 2. Can you generate the following pattern, where the number of rows is determined by
// the value of a variable. Here is an eaample where the numberOfRows is equal to 10.
// Look for a pattern in each row. Hint: Two different characters are used when building
// each row.
//          *
//         **
//        ***
//       ****
//      *****
//     ******
//    *******
//   ********
//  *********
// **********

let numberOfRows = 10;
let row = "";
let count = 0;
while (count < numberOfRows) {
  row = "";
  count = count + 1;
  let numberOfStars = count;
  let numberOfSpaces = numberOfRows - numberOfStars;
  let spaceCount = 0;

    row = row + " ";

  }

}

// 3. Write a JavaScript for loop that will iterate from 0 to 15. For each iteration, it will check
// if the current number is odd or even, and display a message to the screen. Sample
// Output :
// 0 is even
// 1 is odd
// 2 is even
// Before you start, think about how you decide whether a number is odd or even.

let a = 0;
while (a <= 15) {
  if (a % 2 === 0) {

  } else {

// 4. There are two arrays with individual values, write a JavaScript program to compute
// the sum of each individual indea value from the given arrays. Sample array :

let newArray = [];

// [4, 5, 8, 10, 12, 13]

for (let i = 0; i < array2.length; i++) {
